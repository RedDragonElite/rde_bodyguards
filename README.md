## ✨ Features

### 🩹 Self-Heal System

| | |
|---|---|
| **Automatic Healing** | BGs check every 5 seconds if wounded and consume bandage or medkit from their stash inventory. Smart item choice: medkit for critical/serious wounds, bandage for minor. Medical skill improves effectiveness (+0.5% per skill point). Healing is 50% less effective during combat. |
| **Buddy Heal** | BGs with Medical skill 40+ scan for wounded allies within 8m, walk to them, play CPR animation, and heal them. Grants XP and morale to the healer. |
| **Manual Heal** | Player can order any BG to heal via ox_target or F6 menu, bypassing cooldowns. |
| **Bulletproof Backend** | 3-method stash access: `GetInventoryItems` → `GetInventory` → direct MySQL query on `ox_inventory` table. Item removal also uses MySQL fallback. |

### 🔫 Weapon System

| | |
|---|---|
| **Auto-Equip** | BGs automatically equip the best weapon from their stash after arrival. 60+ GTA V weapons recognized with priority ranking. |
| **Weapon Selection** | Player chooses which weapon the BG uses via ox_target menu. All weapons from inventory listed with ammo counts. |
| **Holster Toggle** | Holster/unholster commands via ox_target and F6 menu. BGs can be set to unarmed. |
| **Re-Equip Thread** | Every 30s, BGs check if they've become unarmed and re-equip automatically. |

### 🎯 ox_target Command System

Every active bodyguard ped has 14 direct commands accessible via ox_target:

| Command | Description | Range |
|---|---|---|
| 💬 Interact | Bond interaction with personality animation | 2.5m |
| 🚶 Follow Me | BG follows player in formation | 8m |
| 🛑 Stay Here | BG holds current position (guard mode) | 8m |
| 🔄 Patrol Area | BG patrols around current position | 8m |
| 🎯 Kill Target | BG attacks the ped you're aiming at | 12m |
| 🔥 Attack All | BG engages all hostiles in area | 12m |
| ☮️ Peaceful | Disable combat — BG ignores threats | 8m |
| 😤 Aggressive | Enable combat — BG engages threats | 8m |
| 🩹 Heal | Use bandage/medkit from gear | 3m |
| 🔒 Holster | Put weapon away | 4m |
| 🔓 Draw Weapon | Equip weapon | 4m |
| 🔫 Choose Weapon | Select specific weapon from inventory | 3m |
| 💼 Manage Gear | Open BG's ox_inventory stash | 2.5m |
| 👋 Dismiss | Send BG away with departure animation | 3m |

### 📻 Radial Menu (Remote Control)

* **Per-BG Commands** — Follow, Stay, Attack All, Heal (radial)
* **Global Commands** — All: Follow / Stay / Attack / Heal / Holster / Draw (radial + F6)

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration is in `shared/config.lua`. Key settings:

### Core
```lua
Config.MaxActive   = 3       -- Max simultaneous active BGs
Config.MaxOwned    = 20      -- Max BGs a player can own
```

### Self-Heal
```lua
Config.SelfHeal = {
    enabled         = true,
    checkIntervalMs = 5000,   -- Check every 5s
    cooldownMs      = 30000,  -- 30s between heals
    bandageHealPct  = 0.25,   -- 25% HP restore
    medkitHealPct   = 0.55,   -- 55% HP restore
    minHealthPct    = 0.70,   -- Heal when below 70%
}
```

### Heal Items
```lua
Config.Wounds = {
    selfHealItem = 'bandage', -- Item name in ox_inventory
    medkitItem   = 'medkit',  -- Item name in ox_inventory
}
```

### Economy
```lua
Config.Economy = {
    moneyItem = 'money',      -- ox_inventory cash item
}
```

### Pricing
```lua
Config.Pricing = {
    base        = { min = 8000, max = 25000 },
    perSkillPt  = 120,
    rarityBonus = {
        common = 0, uncommon = 4000, rare = 12000,
        epic = 28000, legendary = 65000,
    },
}
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Self-Heal Not Working?
```
✅ Check server console for: "[RDE-BG] SelfHeal BG X: bandage=Y medkit=Z"
✅ Ensure items are named exactly as Config.Wounds.selfHealItem / medkitItem
✅ Verify items are in the BG's stash (💼 Manage Gear), not player inventory
✅ BG must be below 70% HP to auto-heal (Config.SelfHeal.minHealthPct)
```

### Weapons Not Equipping?
```
✅ Put weapons in BG's gear stash (💼 Manage Gear via ox_target)
✅ Weapon names must follow ox_inventory convention (e.g. 'WEAPON_PISTOL')
✅ Check server console for weapon detection logs
✅ Try manual equip via 🔫 Choose Weapon in ox_target
```

### AnimDict Errors?
```
✅ v5.2 wraps all anim loading in pcall — errors are non-fatal
✅ If you see errors, the anim simply won't play but nothing crashes
```

### BG Not Arriving?
```
✅ Vehicle arrival has 120s timeout — traffic/detours need time
✅ Foot arrival has 90s timeout with stuck detection
✅ Check server console for spawn authorization logs
```
